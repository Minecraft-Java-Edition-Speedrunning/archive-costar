A simple mod that addresses a questionable design decision in minecraft for versions 1.9-1.12 (fixed in 1.12.1-pre1) that affects fabric: the `root.tick.level.entities.blockEntities` directive in the piechart uses `Class#getSimpleName` for the profiler location, leading to fabric having different names from vanilla (and different names in dev than in prod) due to the fact that fabric remaps almost all symbols in the game jar to an intermediary layer. To fix this vanilla parity issue, I just switch out the name with its unmapped equivalent.
